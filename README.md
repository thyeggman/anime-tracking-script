# Anime tracking script
Just a script to help jurors in the /r/anime awards track what they need to catch up on.

## Instructions

1. Open the template (TODO - link to template)
1. Make a copy of the template
1. Go to Extensions -> Apps Script
1. Paste in the script from this repo
1. Run the script
1. You will need to approve your account to run the script and get access to sheets (this API does not need authentication so it's completely safe)
1. Go back to your spreadsheet - you should now have an "anime" menu button at the top
1. Fill out the anilist usernames in the first row starting from H1
1. Enter the anime IDs you want to track in column 1 starting from A2
1. Use Anime -> Update sheet

The anime will not fill out unless at least one juror has it on their list.
